# Front-end Portfolio Project

For this project, I built a website that I made using the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api) URL to get different end-points and get data of dogs breeds. This End-Point gets photos of dogs of a selected breed. This project covers all the requirements and extra add ons.
